This directory contains the output dataframes of scripts 1.calculate_longterm_means.R and 2.prep_SHAP.R

Subdirectories:
dataframes: processed data saved in R native format (.rds)
NetCDFs: processed data saved as NetCDFs (useful for further steps of the process) 

The final summary dataframes of 1.means_troughout.R (df_int_bins.rds) is too big to be uploaded on Git. It can easily be reproduced with the script 1.calculate_longterm_means.R and the other dataframes in this directory.

Similarly, df_SHAP.rds is also too big for GitHub (it can be produced with 2.prep_SHAP.R)
